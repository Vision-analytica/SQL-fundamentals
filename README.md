But Going into more details on SQL, first lets know what are main query languages used, what are database and understand differences between few terminology.

# Query Languages (QL)

- QL is a general term used to describe a variety of query languages used in database management systems (DBMS). 
- These query languages are used to interact with the database, allowing users to search, retrieve, and modify data stored within the system.

## Important Query languages:

There are numerous Query Languages (QL) used in database management systems (DBMS). Some of the most common QLs include:

1. <font color="blue">**SQL (Structured Query Language)** - used to communicate with relational databases.</font>

2. **XQuery** - used to retrieve and manipulate data stored in XML documents.

3. **SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language)** - used to query and manipulate data stored in RDF databases.

4. **Cypher** - used to query graph databases.

5. **Gremlin** - used to traverse and manipulate graph data stored in graph databases.

6. **MDX (Multidimensional Expressions)** - used to query data stored in multidimensional databases.

7. **Datalog** - used to query and reason about data stored in deductive databases.

8. **FQL (Facebook Query Language)** - used to query data stored in Facebook's data infrastructure.

9. **SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language)** - used to query data stored in Salesforce's customer relationship management (CRM) system.

10. **OQL (Object Query Language)** - used to query and manipulate data stored in object-oriented databases.

These are just a few examples of the many QLs used in database management systems.

## Some of the advantages of SQL

- **Easy to learn:** SQL has a simple and easy-to-understand syntax, which makes it easy for beginners to learn.
- **Portable:** SQL is a standard language, which means that it can be used with a variety of relational database management systems (RDBMS).
- **High performance:** SQL is optimized for performance and can handle large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.
- **Scalable:** SQL databases can scale easily by adding more servers or increasing the resources of existing servers.
- **Flexible:** SQL can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, from simple queries to complex analytics and data mining.
- **Secure:** SQL includes built-in security features that can help protect against data breaches and unauthorized access.
- **Ad-hoc querying:** SQL allows users to run ad-hoc queries against their data, which can be useful for exploring data and finding insights.
- **Data integrity:** SQL databases include features such as transactions and constraints that help ensure the integrity of the data stored in the database.
- **Ease of integration:** SQL databases can be easily integrated with other applications and tools, making it easy to access and analyze data from different sources.
- **Standardization:** SQL is a standardized language, which means that developers can use the same language and code across different databases and platforms.

## Disadvantages of SQL
With the advantages of SQL, it also has some disadvantages, which are as follows:

- **Complexity:** SQL can be complex and difficult to learn, especially for those who are new to programming.
- **Limited scalability:** SQL databases can struggle with scalability when it comes to handling large volumes of data, especially when compared to NoSQL databases.
- **Limited flexibility:** SQL databases are designed to handle structured data, which means they may not be as flexible as NoSQL databases when it comes to handling unstructured or semi-structured data.
- **Cost:** SQL databases can be expensive, especially when using commercial database management systems.
- **Security concerns:** SQL databases can be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, which can result in data loss or corruption.
- **Performance issues:** SQL databases can experience performance issues, especially when complex queries are involved. This can be exacerbated when dealing with large data sets.

## 1. What is Data?

Data are
   - individual facts
   - statistics
   - items of information
 
## 2. Role of data in a program

All the programs can be divided into two major parts.

   - Code (or algorithms)
   - Data

The code in a program is static. But data is dynamic. Hence the runtime behavior of a program is largely dependent on data.

## 3. Data categories

Data can be broadly categorized into 3 categories based on its format.

   - Structured
   - Unstructured
   - Semi-Structured
 
 ### 3.1. Structured Data

   Structured Data aka "Quantitative Data" is the data which
   
   - has a well-defined structure
   - conforms to a data model
   - can be easily accessed and, used

   Structured data accounts for only about 20% of data. Examples: Name, Address.
   
 ### 3.2. Unstructured Data

   Unstructured Data aka "Qualitative Data" is the data which
   - does not have any predefined data model
   - cannot be processed by conventional tools

   Unstructured data accounts for about 80% of data. Examples: Text Files, Audio/Videos.
   
 ### 3.3. Semi-structured Data

  - semi-structured data is the ‚Äúbridge‚Äù between structured and unstructured data.
  - It does not have a predefined data model and is more complex than structured data, yet easier to store than unstructured data.
  - Mostly in JSON/XML/CSV formats.
 
## 4. What is a Database?

A database is ‚ùùan organized collection of data‚ùû.

   - stored in a computer system so that
   - it can be easily accessed and managed
   
## 5. Database Model

- A database model is a data model that determines the logical structure of a database.
- It fundamentally determines how data can be stored, organized, and manipulated.
- One popular database model is the relational model, which uses a table-based format.

## 6. What is DBMS?
 
DBMS stands for Database Management System.

- DBMS is the software that is used to manage a database (whereas a database is for storage).
- A DBMS interacts with
    - end users
    - applications
    - database

A DBMS would typically take care of

    ‚ùØ AuthN & AuthZ
    ‚ùØ Create, Modify, Delete a Database
    ‚ùØ Create, Modify, Delete Database Objects
    ‚ùØ Create, Modify, Delete Data
    ‚ùØ Query Data
    ‚ùØ Handle transactions


## 7. DBMS categories

- Broadly DBMS are categorized into
    - Relational DBMS (RDBMS)
    - NoSQL
- RDBMS handles relational models and manages structured data.
- NoSQL comes with various database models and manages both unstructured and semi-structured data.

## 8. What is a Relational Database?

A relational database is a ‚ùùcollection of data items‚ùû that have some ‚ùùpre-defined relationships‚ùû between them.

These items are organized as a set of "Tables" with "Columns" and "Rows".
- A relationship between 2 tables is established based on one or multiple similar columns.

## 9. What is SQL?

"SQL stands for Structured Query Language".
- SQL is a computer language for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in a relational database.
- SQL provides useful commands for performing these operations.

## 10. Need for SQL

- Because of its popularity, multiple vendors started their own implementations of relational databases.
- The need to develop one common language for managing both data and structures became necessary.


## 11. SQL Commands, explained

   - DDL
   - DML
   - DQL
