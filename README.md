## 1. What is Data?

Data are
   - individual facts
   - statistics
   - items of information
 
## 2. Role of data in a program

All the programs can be divided into two major parts.

   - Code (or algorithms)
   - Data

The code in a program is static. But data is dynamic. Hence the runtime behavior of a program is largely dependent on data.

## 3. Data categories

Data can be broadly categorized into 3 categories based on its format.

   - Structured
   - Unstructured
   - Semi-Structured
 
 ### 3.1. Structured Data

   Structured Data aka "Quantitative Data" is the data which
   
   - has a well-defined structure
   - conforms to a data model
   - can be easily accessed and, used

   Structured data accounts for only about 20% of data. Examples: Name, Address.
   
 ### 3.2. Unstructured Data

   Unstructured Data aka "Qualitative Data" is the data which
   - does not have any predefined data model
   - cannot be processed by conventional tools

   Unstructured data accounts for about 80% of data. Examples: Text Files, Audio/Videos.
   
 ### 3.3. Semi-structured Data

  - semi-structured data is the ‚Äúbridge‚Äù between structured and unstructured data.
  - It does not have a predefined data model and is more complex than structured data, yet easier to store than unstructured data.
  - Mostly in JSON/XML/CSV formats.
 
## 4. What is a Database?

A database is ‚ùùan organized collection of data‚ùû.

   - stored in a computer system so that
   - it can be easily accessed and managed
   
## 5. Database Model

- A database model is a data model that determines the logical structure of a database.
- It fundamentally determines how data can be stored, organized, and manipulated.
- One popular database model is the relational model, which uses a table-based format.

## 6. What is DBMS?
 
DBMS stands for Database Management System.

- DBMS is the software that is used to manage a database (whereas a database is for storage).
- A DBMS interacts with
    - end users
    - applications
    - database

A DBMS would typically take care of

    ‚ùØ AuthN & AuthZ
    ‚ùØ Create, Modify, Delete a Database
    ‚ùØ Create, Modify, Delete Database Objects
    ‚ùØ Create, Modify, Delete Data
    ‚ùØ Query Data
    ‚ùØ Handle transactions


## 7. DBMS categories

- Broadly DBMS are categorized into
    - Relational DBMS (RDBMS)
    - NoSQL
- RDBMS handles relational models and manages structured data.
- NoSQL comes with various database models and manages both unstructured and semi-structured data.

## 8. What is a Relational Database?

A relational database is a ‚ùùcollection of data items‚ùû that have some ‚ùùpre-defined relationships‚ùû between them.

These items are organized as a set of "Tables" with "Columns" and "Rows".
- A relationship between 2 tables is established based on one or multiple similar columns.

## 9. What is SQL?

"SQL stands for Structured Query Language".
- SQL is a computer language for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in a relational database.
- SQL provides useful commands for performing these operations.

## 10. Need for SQL

- Because of its popularity, multiple vendors started their own implementations of relational databases.
- The need to develop one common language for managing both data and structures became necessary.


## 11. SQL Commands, explained

   - DDL
   - DML
   - DQL
   - DCL
   - TCL

### 11.1. DDL
  
DDL  ‚ûü  Data Definition Language

- DDL commands are used to define the database schema.
- DDL is a set of SQL commands that are used to create, modify, and delete database structures but not data.

#### List of DDL Commands

- CREATE: Used to create the database or its objects (like Table, Views, Stored Procedures, Index, etc.)
- DROP: Used to delete objects from the database.
- ALTER: Used to alter the structure of the database.
- TRUNCATE: Used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records.
- RENAME: Used to rename an object already existing in the database.
- COMMENT: Used to add comments to the data dictionary.
     
### 11.2. DML

DML  ‚ûü  Data Manipulation Language

- DML commands are used to manipulate the data present in the database.

#### List of DML Commands

- INSERT: Used to insert data into a table.
- UPDATE: Used to update existing data within a table.
- DELETE: Used to delete records from a database table.
- LOCK: Used to control the concurrency on a table.
- CALL: Used to call a PL/SQL code.
- EXPLAIN PLAN: To describe the access path to data.

### 11.3. DQL

DQL  ‚ûü  Data Query Language

- DQL commands are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects.

#### List of DQL Commands

- SELECT: Used to retrieve data from the database.

### 11.4. DCL

DCL  ‚ûü  Data Control Language

- DCL commands mainly deal with the rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system.

#### List of DCL Commands

- GRANT: To give users access privileges to the database.
- REVOKE: To withdraw the user‚Äôs access privileges.

### 11.5. TCL

TCL  ‚ûü  Transaction Control Language

- TCL commands deal with the transaction within the database.

#### List of TCL Commands

- COMMIT: Used to commit a transaction.
- ROLLBACK: Used to rollback a transaction in case of any error occurs.
- SAVEPOINT: Used to set a savepoint within a transaction.
- SET TRANSACTION: Used to specify characteristics for the transaction.
